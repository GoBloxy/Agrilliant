# Agrilliant Android Migration — Current Status

> Branch: `mobile-app` | Last updated: 2026-05-14
> Tracks: **Hagag** (Build / Data / IoT — §8.A) + **3bdelbary** (UI / Navigation / Resources — §8.B)

---

## Summary

The Agrilliant desktop JavaFX app is being migrated to Android via Gluon Mobile (Glisten + Attach + GluonFX native-image). Both Phase 1 tracks have made substantial progress:

<<<<<<< C:/Users/moham/Agrilliant/docs/STATUS.md
- **Hagag's track (H1–H11):** Complete. All build, data, and infrastructure tasks are done.
- **3bdelbary's track (B1–B10):** Complete. B1 (Gluon `MobileApplication`), B2 (AppView nav), B3 + B3X (mobile-friendly FXMLs + UX rework), B4 (FileChooser sweep), B5 (`mobile.css`), B6 (JFreeChart audit), B7 (launcher icons — 10 PNGs generated and committed), B8 (`PlatformPickers`), B9 (lifecycle hooks), and B10 (consolidated FXML / controller / Phase 2 reference matrices in `MIGRATION_3BDELBARY.md`). All 3bdelbary-track Phase 1 work is done. Outstanding items are entirely cross-track on Hagag's side.
=======
- **Hagag's track (H1–H11):** Complete.
- **3bdelbary's track (B1–B10):** Complete.
- **Post-B10 cross-track follow-ups (user-authorized):** JFreeChart deps removed from `pom.xml`; Gluon Attach `LifecycleService` PAUSE/RESUME wired to `DashboardController.startLifecycle()`/`stopLifecycle()`; `Crop.GrowthStage='GROWING'` SQL workaround migration script committed at `docs/sql/2026-05-14-fix-growthstage-growing.sql`. The repo is now ready for the first `mvn -Pandroid gluonfx:build`.
>>>>>>> C:/Users/moham/.windsurf/worktrees/Agrilliant/Agrilliant-f99a6225/docs/STATUS.md

The app compiles cleanly on both profiles and boots through Splash → SignIn on desktop. No Android APK has been built yet (needs GraalVM + Android SDK toolchain).

## What Is Accomplished

### Hagag Track (Build / Data / IoT) — ALL DONE

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| H1 | GluonFX Maven plugin + desktop/android profiles | Done |
| H2 | GraalVM native-image config seeds (reflect, resource, jni JSON) | Done |
| H3 | AndroidManifest.xml + permissions | Done |
| H4 | DBConnection rewrite: lazy init, layered creds (env → Settings → properties), async helper | Done |
| H5 | Logger API + DAO thread-safety documentation sweep | Done |
| H6 | SessionManager via Gluon Settings + file fallback + HMAC migration | Done |
| H7 | FingerprintService: Android stub + desktop impl split (SPI pattern) | Done |
| H8 | CSVExporter: `saveCsv()` using Gluon Storage / `~/Downloads` | Done |
| H9 | `Constants.IS_ANDROID` + desktop-only headers on server classes | Done |
| H10 | Logger → `android.util.Log` reflection routing + ThresholdConfig from properties | Done |
| H11 | Migration documentation | Done |
| Review | Post-review fixes: race condition, perf caching, doc corrections, RFC-4180 CSV quoting | Done |

### 3bdelbary Track (UI / Navigation / Resources) — ALL DONE

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| B1 | Convert `Main.java` to Gluon `MobileApplication` with 4 view factories (SPLASH, SIGNIN, SIGNUP, SHELL) | Done |
| B2 | Replace `Stage` navigation with `AppManager.switchView()` across SignIn/SignUp/Dashboard/Shell | Done |
| B3 | Make every FXML mobile-friendly: drop hardcoded sizes, TableView → CharmListView, remove hover-only tooltips | Done |
| B3X | UX rework: vertical auth forms, FlowPane summary/filters, NavigationDrawer + AppBar, alerts stacked layout | Done |
| Fix | `CropController.colVariety` NPE — dropped dead `@FXML` field + its 2 references (column had no backing model field) | Done |
| B4 | Replace 8 `FileChooser` call sites: 7 CSV exports → `CSVExporter.saveCsv()`, 1 image picker → `PlatformPickers.pickImage()` | Done |
| B5 | `css/mobile.css` with ≥48dp touch targets, 16 px base font, `CharmListView`/drawer row bumps. Loaded only on Android via `Constants.IS_ANDROID` branch in `Main.postInit` | Done |
| B6 | JFreeChart audit — 0 references in `src/`; FX-thread safety of `MonitoringController.subscribeLiveSensor` confirmed via `LiveSensorData.update` → `Platform.runLater`; defensive `TODO(phase-2)` added in `setupTrendChart` for bounded-series rule | Done |
| B7 | 10 Android launcher PNGs (5 densities mdpi → xxxhdpi × square + round variants) generated from `images/logo.png` and committed under `src/android/res/mipmap-*/`. Two side-by-side generators ship: Java (`smartfarm.ui.tools.LauncherIconGenerator`) and PowerShell (`generate-launcher-icons.ps1`). Both use the shared `smartfarm.ui.platform.PngEncoder` / `System.Drawing` to produce byte-equivalent layouts — `#2e7d32` background, logo at 72% edge, circular clip on round variant. | Done |
| B8 | `smartfarm.ui.platform.PlatformPickers` with Gluon `PicturesService` on Android, `FileChooser` on desktop, pure-Java PNG encoder for Substrate-safe persistence | Done |
| B9 | Lifecycle hooks sweep: zero `stage.setOn*` patterns in `ui/` (B1/B2 already eliminated); `MonitoringController` listener leak across `loadFxmlPage` page swaps fixed via `sceneProperty()` auto-detach; `DashboardController` `Timeline` + 5 `LiveSensorData` listeners promoted to instance fields with new public `stopLifecycle()` method ready for Phase 2 `LifecycleService.PAUSE` wiring | Done |
| B10 | Final consolidation: per-FXML status matrix (12 rows), per-controller status matrix (17 rows), 4 Gluon View status, consolidated Phase 2 TODO list (async / lifecycle / layout / assets / tests / frozen-model), cross-track items waiting on Hagag, read-only-imports recap, complete file inventory across the track. See `docs/MIGRATION_3BDELBARY.md` §B10. | Done |

#### B1 Key Deliverables
- `AppView.java` — 4-value enum mapping to Gluon View names (SPLASH → HOME_VIEW)
- `NavContext.java` — singleton cross-view session state
- `SplashView.java` — logo + spinner + async session restore with 800ms min-visible guard
- `SignInView.java` / `SignUpView.java` — wrap existing FXMLs
- `ShellView.java` — wraps dashboard, configures NavigationDrawer + AppBar
- `Main.java` — extends `MobileApplication`, registers 4 lazy view factories, starts FarmServer reflectively (desktop only)

#### B2 Key Deliverables
- All `Stage`/`Scene`/`setRoot` navigation replaced with `AppView.X.switchTo()`
- Zero `import javafx.stage.Stage` remaining in `smartfarm/ui/`

#### B3 Key Deliverables
- 12 FXMLs: all hardcoded root sizes removed
- 4 list-shaped views converted to `CharmListView` with `CharmListCell` + `ListTile` rows (workers, tasks, harvest, logs)
- Hover-only tooltips removed from `plots.fxml`
- Defensive `RuntimeException` catch added to `HarvestController` for null-DB DAOs

#### B3X Key Deliverables
- `signin.fxml` / `signup.fxml`: two-column HBox → vertical stack (branding header + full-width form)
- Summary card rows on 8 inner pages: `HBox` → `FlowPane` with `minWidth=200` (wraps responsively)
- Filter rows on 8 inner pages: `HBox` → `FlowPane` with `minWidth=240` search box
- `dashboard.fxml`: fixed 240dp sidebar replaced with Gluon `NavigationDrawer` (hamburger slide-in) + `AppBar`
- `alerts.fxml`: side-by-side `HBox` → stacked `VBox` (list on top, detail below)
- `DashboardController`: new `navigate(NavTarget)` public API + `NavTarget` enum (14 targets)
- Sidebar/topbar hidden via `visible="false" managed="false"` (preserves existing controller logic)

#### B4 + B8 Key Deliverables
- `PlatformPickers.pickImage(Window) → Optional<File>` in new package `smartfarm.ui.platform` — Gluon `PicturesService` on Android (with pure-Java PNG encoder for Substrate-safe persistence to private storage), `FileChooser` on desktop
- 7 CSV exports rewritten to build `StringBuilder` content then `CSVExporter.saveCsv(content, name)` — `DashboardController` ×4 (`onExportReport`, `onExportSensorCSV`, `onExportHarvestCSV`, `onExportAlertCSV`), `LogsController.onExport`, `ReportsController.onExport`, `CropController.onExport`. Column layouts preserved verbatim.
- `DiseaseDetectionPage.selectImage` now uses `PlatformPickers.pickImage(getScene().getWindow())` with `Optional.ifPresent`. Downstream `PlantIdService.analyzeImage(String)` unchanged — `PlatformPickers` always returns a real file path on both platforms.
- `javafx.stage.FileChooser` references in `ui/`: **0** (only the legitimate desktop fallback inside `PlatformPickers` itself)
- `FileWriter` references in `src/`: **0** (all replaced with `CSVExporter.saveCsv()`)

#### B5 Key Deliverables
- New stylesheet `src/main/resources/css/mobile.css` (~110 lines, ~25 selectors). Bumps base font to 16 px on `.root`, enforces 48dp min-height on every tappable control (`.button`, `.text-field`, `.combo-box`, `.date-picker`, `.menu-button`, dialog buttons), bumps `.list-tile` / `.charm-list-cell` to 84dp (fits a 3-line tile with 48dp action buttons), drawer rows to 56dp (Material spec).
- **Loaded only on Android** — `Main.postInit` now branches on `Constants.IS_ANDROID`: Android picks up `mobile.css` after `farm-theme.css`; desktop keeps its dashboard-optimized sizing untouched. Avoids the "desktop UI suddenly looks like the phone" failure mode flagged in §8.B5's verification gate.
- The width-based dashboard sidebar toggle mentioned in the B3X follow-ups is deferred to Phase 2 — not implementable in pure JavaFX CSS (no media queries). Needs a `Scene.widthProperty()` listener instead.

#### B6 Key Deliverables
- Verified `src/` has zero JFreeChart references (`jfree`, `JFreeChart`, `ChartFactory`, `ChartPanel`, `XYPlot`, `JFreeChart-FX`). The B3-era survey had already moved away from it; B6 is the formal sign-off.
- Verified `MonitoringController.subscribeLiveSensor` fires UI setters on the FX thread — the indirection runs through `LiveSensorData.update(...)`, which wraps its property mutations in `Platform.runLater`.
- Added defensive `TODO(phase-2)` block comment in `MonitoringController.setupTrendChart()` documenting the bounded-series rule for the next engineer wiring real live data (cap series at N, trim from head before append). The current chart is mock-only so unbounded growth doesn't manifest, but the comment captures the gotcha.
- **Hagag follow-up:** `pom.xml` desktop profile still declares `org.jfree:jfreechart:1.5.4` + `org.jfree:jfreechart-fx:1.0.1` with a comment waiting on exactly this audit. Safe to drop now — trims ~3 MB from the desktop fat-jar.

#### B7 Key Deliverables
- New `smartfarm.ui.platform.PngEncoder` — PNG encoder extracted from `PlatformPickers` (B8) into a reusable utility. RGBA, filter type 0, single IDAT, deflate via `java.util.zip`. Substrate-safe (no `java.desktop`/`javafx.swing`). Single public method `encode(Image) → byte[]`.
- `PlatformPickers` refactored to delegate to `PngEncoder` — ~60 fewer lines, identical behaviour.
- New `smartfarm.ui.tools.LauncherIconGenerator` (JavaFX `Application`) — reads `images/logo.png`, renders 5 densities (mdpi 48 → xxxhdpi 192) × 2 variants (square + round), writes via `PngEncoder` to `src/android/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher{,_round}.png`. Run via `mvn -Pdesktop compile exec:java`.
- New `src/main/java/smartfarm/ui/tools/generate-launcher-icons.ps1` — PowerShell mirror using `System.Drawing` for environments without the full Maven toolchain. Used to produce the committed PNGs.
- **10 launcher PNG bitmaps generated and committed** at:
  ```
  src/android/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png        (48×48)
  src/android/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher_round.png  (48×48)
  src/android/res/mipmap-hdpi/...                    (72×72)
  src/android/res/mipmap-xhdpi/...                   (96×96)
  src/android/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/...                  (144×144)
  src/android/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/...                 (192×192)
  ```
  Each icon is the `#2e7d32` brand-green background with the bird logo centred at 72% of the edge. Round variants use an antialiased circular background with a clip path so the logo can't bleed outside the disc.

#### B9 Key Deliverables
- **Audit clean for `stage.setOn*` / `windowProperty` patterns** — zero hits across `src/main/java/smartfarm/ui` (B1/B2 already eliminated them). All 4 Gluon Views (`SplashView`, `SignInView`, `SignUpView`, `ShellView`) use `setOnShowing` / `setOnHiding`.
- **`MonitoringController` listener leak fixed.** Each visit to the Monitoring tab was attaching 3 lambdas to the `LiveSensorData` singleton without ever detaching, keeping the old controller alive. Promoted the lambdas to `ChangeListener<Number>` fields and hook `lblTemp.sceneProperty()` so when the scene goes `null` (page unmounted by `DashboardController.loadFxmlPage`), `unsubscribeLiveSensor()` removes all three from the singleton. Pattern documented for any future sub-page controllers that grow service-singleton subscriptions.
- **`DashboardController` lifecycle handles in place for Phase 2.** Today the shell caches the controller for the JVM lifetime so its `Timeline` clock and 5 `LiveSensorData` listeners don't actually leak — but they tick / fire even when the app is OS-backgrounded. Refactor:
  - `Timeline clock` promoted from a local to an instance field; `updateDateTime()` is idempotent (early-return if already started).
  - 5 listeners (`liveTempListener`, `liveHumListener`, `liveSoilListener`, `liveDeviceListener`, `activeSensorsListener`) promoted to `ChangeListener` fields with null-guarded attach.
  - New public `stopLifecycle()` method stops the clock and removes all 5 listeners. Idempotent. Documented as the intended hook for Phase 2's Gluon Attach `LifecycleService.PAUSE` event.
- **Rotation safety confirmed.** `AndroidManifest.xml` declares `android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|screenSize|smallestScreenSize"` on the launcher activity, so orientation changes don't tear down and rebuild the Activity / JVM. The field-backed `Timeline` provides defense-in-depth for any future scenario where the JVM does restart.

### Build Verification

## What Is Missing
<<<<<<< C:/Users/moham/Agrilliant/docs/STATUS.md

Nothing on 3bdelbary's Phase 1 list. All B-tasks are complete.

### Cross-track items waiting on Hagag
- **`pom.xml` JFreeChart cleanup** — B6 audit confirmed `src/` has zero JFreeChart references. The desktop profile still declares `org.jfree:jfreechart:1.5.4` + `org.jfree:jfreechart-fx:1.0.1` with a comment explicitly waiting on this audit. Safe to drop now. Trims ~3 MB from the desktop fat-jar.
- **`exec-maven-plugin` for the launcher generator (optional)** — if the team wants `LauncherIconGenerator` invokable via `mvn exec:java`, Hagag adds the plugin to the desktop profile's `<plugins>` block. The PowerShell variant (`generate-launcher-icons.ps1`) is already a working alternative that needs no Maven plumbing.
- **Gluon Attach `LifecycleService` integration (Phase 2)** — B9 left a public `DashboardController.stopLifecycle()` hook unwired. Phase 2 should register a `LifecycleService` listener in `Main` that calls `controller.stopLifecycle()` on `PAUSE` and a future `startLifecycle()` on `RESUME` so the dashboard idles while the app is OS-backgrounded.
=======

Nothing on 3bdelbary's Phase 1 list. All B-tasks are complete and the post-B10 cross-track items the user pulled forward (JFreeChart pom cleanup, LifecycleService wiring, SQL migration) are also done.

The only remaining work is environmental — running the actual APK build on a host with GraalVM + Android SDK + NDK installed. See `docs/MIGRATION_3BDELBARY.md` *Post-B10 → APK build pre-flight checklist* for the exact command sequence and common first-run failure modes.

### Cross-track items still pending (low priority)
- **`exec-maven-plugin` for the launcher generator (optional)** — would let the team run `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=smartfarm.ui.tools.LauncherIconGenerator`. The PowerShell variant (`src/main/java/smartfarm/ui/tools/generate-launcher-icons.ps1`) is the working alternative that needs no Maven plumbing.
- **Phase 2 async DAO sweep** — wrap every DAO call site in `DBConnection.runAsync(...)`. See the per-controller `⚠` rows in `docs/MIGRATION_3BDELBARY.md` §B10.

## Known Errors and Issues

### 1. FXML Load Failures (2/12) — Retested 2026-05-14 with real DB

Retested with `db.properties` pointing to the real MySQL at `139.59.153.80`. DB connection now succeeds, which changed the failure profile: `monitoring.fxml` now passes (was failing with DB NPE before), and `crops.fxml` now passes after the `colVariety` dead-code removal. Two FXMLs still fail — both with the `Crop.GrowthStage.GROWING` enum mismatch, not the previous "no DB" NPEs.

**Full smoke results:**

| FXML | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| `signin.fxml` | PASS | |
| `signup.fxml` | PASS | |
| `dashboard.fxml` | **FAIL** | `IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant smartfarm.model.Crop.GrowthStage.GROWING` — DB has `growth_stage='GROWING'` but the Java enum only defines `SEED, SEEDLING, VEGETATIVE, FLOWERING, FRUITING, HARVESTED` |
| `crops.fxml` | PASS | (was failing on `colVariety` NPE; fixed by dropping the dead field from `CropController`) |
| `plots.fxml` | PASS | (logs `IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant Crop.GrowthStage.GROWING` but catches it — `PlotController.initialize` has a try/catch guard) |
| `workers.fxml` | PASS | |
| `tasks.fxml` | PASS | |
| `alerts.fxml` | PASS | |
| `monitoring.fxml` | PASS | (was failing without DB; now works with real DB) |
| `harvest.fxml` | PASS | |
| `reports.fxml` | **FAIL** | `IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant smartfarm.model.Crop.GrowthStage.GROWING` — same enum mismatch as dashboard |
| `logs.fxml` | PASS | |

**Root cause #1 — `Crop.GrowthStage` enum vs DB data mismatch:**

The `crops` table contains rows with `growth_stage = 'GROWING'`, but `Crop.GrowthStage` only defines:
```java
public enum GrowthStage { SEED, SEEDLING, VEGETATIVE, FLOWERING, FRUITING, HARVESTED }
```
`CropDAO.extractCrop()` calls `Crop.GrowthStage.valueOf(rs.getString("growth_stage"))` which throws `IllegalArgumentException` for any value not in the enum. This crashes `dashboard.fxml` and `reports.fxml` during `initialize()`. `plots.fxml` survives because `PlotController.initialize()` wraps the call in a try/catch.

**Fix options:** (a) Add `GROWING` to the enum (if the DB value is intentional), (b) UPDATE the DB rows to use a valid enum value like `VEGETATIVE`, or (c) Make `CropDAO.extractCrop()` handle unknown enum values gracefully (e.g. default to `VEGETATIVE`). Options (a) and (c) touch `smartfarm/model/` and `smartfarm/dao/` — Hagag's lane / frozen for Phase 1 — so the immediate workaround is option (b) via SQL.

**Previous (no-DB) smoke for comparison:**

Before the env files were added (no DB credentials), the smoke was 8/12 pass. The 4 failures were all `NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "...Connection.createStatement()" because "this.conn" is null` in `dashboard`, `crops`, `monitoring`, `reports`. With the real DB connected, `monitoring` now passes and (after the `colVariety` dead-code removal) `crops` also passes. The 2 remaining failures (`dashboard` + `reports`) surface their real root cause — the `Crop.GrowthStage.GROWING` enum mismatch — instead of the generic "no DB" NPE.

### 2. Headless Monocle NagScreen Crash — Glisten + headless-only

Under headless Monocle (no display), Glisten's `NagScreenPresenter` (triggered by missing license file) calls `enterNestedEventLoop`, which Monocle's strict event-thread check rejects. Not an app code bug — only affects headless test environments. On real displays the nag dialog renders fine.

### 3. NavigationDrawer Not Visually Tested

The ShellView drawer + AppBar configuration is compile-verified but has not been visually smoke-tested with a real login session (requires DB credentials). The drawer items call `DashboardController.navigate(NavTarget)` which delegates to the existing `loadFxmlPage` path — this should work but hasn't been confirmed end-to-end.

### 4. No Android APK Built Yet

The full `mvn -Pandroid gluonfx:build` → APK pipeline has not been run. Requires:
- GraalVM / Liberica NIK installed
- Android SDK + NDK available
- B7 launcher icons in place (otherwise manifest references fail)

### 5. `FarmServer.class` Still Leaks into Android Build

`Main.java` no longer statically imports `FarmServer`, but javac may still implicit-compile it. The `**/smartfarm/server/**/*.java` exclude in the android profile should now be structurally effective after B1's rewrite, but this hasn't been confirmed by inspecting the Android `target/classes` output.

---

## Phase 2 TODOs (12 in-code markers)

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| DAO cached-connection field → per-method call | 11 | One per DAO: `AdminDAO`, `AlertDAO`, `AttendanceDAO`, `CropDAO`, `DeviceDAO`, `HarvestDAO`, `ManagerDAO`, `PlotDAO`, `SensorDAO`, `TaskDAO`, `WorkerDAO` |
| NavContext unit tests | 1 | Awaiting JUnit/Surefire in pom.xml |

Additional Phase 2 items from the migration docs (not in-code):
- Wire `DBConnection.closeQuietly()` into `Main#stop()` and a Gluon `LifecycleEvent.DESTROY` listener
- Run GraalVM agent on desktop session to expand reflect-config (especially mysql-connector-j)
- Add "Settings" admin screen for first-run DB credentials
- Flip `usesCleartextTraffic="false"` for release builds
- Relocate `SECRET_KEY` out of source code
- Android USB-OTG fingerprint backend implementation
- Verify `adb logcat` Logger output on real device
- APK content audit (`server.*` classes absent)

## Recommended Next Steps

<<<<<<< C:/Users/moham/Agrilliant/docs/STATUS.md
1. **Run first `mvn -Pandroid gluonfx:build`** to produce an APK. All 3bdelbary-track assets and code are in place (Gluon Views, mobile.css, launcher icons, FXML mobile-friendliness, lifecycle hooks). This is the next concrete milestone for the project.
2. **Fix `Crop.GrowthStage` enum mismatch** — UPDATE the DB rows to a valid enum value (e.g. `VEGETATIVE`) so `dashboard` + `reports` FXMLs load cleanly. Enum or DAO fix paths cross into Hagag's lane / frozen `model/`.
3. **Hagag:** drop JFreeChart deps from `pom.xml` desktop profile (B6 audit complete); optionally add `exec-maven-plugin` to make the Java icon generator invokable via `mvn exec:java`; wire Gluon Attach `LifecycleService` in `Main` to dispatch PAUSE/RESUME into `DashboardController.stopLifecycle()` (B9 Phase 2 hand-off).
4. **Phase 2 async DAO sweep** — wrap every DAO call site in `DBConnection.runAsync(...)`. See the per-controller table (⚠ rows) in `docs/MIGRATION_3BDELBARY.md` §B10.
=======
1. **Apply the SQL migration** to fix `Crop.GrowthStage='GROWING'` so `dashboard` + `reports` FXMLs load:
   ```
   mysql -h <host> -u <user> -p <db> < docs/sql/2026-05-14-fix-growthstage-growing.sql
   ```
   Idempotent. The script reports row counts before and after.
2. **Run first `mvn -Pandroid gluonfx:build`** on a host with GraalVM CE 22+ / Liberica NIK 23+, Android SDK (`platforms;android-35`, `build-tools;35.0.0`), and Android NDK ≥ 25.x installed. Walkthrough + failure modes in `docs/MIGRATION_3BDELBARY.md` *Post-B10 → APK build pre-flight checklist*.
3. **Phase 2 async DAO sweep** — wrap every DAO call site in `DBConnection.runAsync(...)`. See the per-controller `⚠` rows in `docs/MIGRATION_3BDELBARY.md` §B10.
4. **(Optional) `exec-maven-plugin`** in the desktop profile so the Java launcher-icon generator is `mvn exec:java`-invokable. Not needed for the APK build.
